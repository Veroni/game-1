Ocean war.
A simple game.

Two maps with 8 ships each. 
4-1
3-2
2-3
1-4
One of the maps is visible to the user. 
Another one created by a computer with ships randomly generated on the map.
Ships cannot stay near each other. By diagonal is ok.

A user start the game and shoot a missal trying to find computer's ships. 
If the user misses, computer turn begins.
If the user hit the piece of the ship it's shown and the user shoots again. 

When all the ships got killed, the board looses. The opposite board wins.
